  Hello World. My name is Bipin Regmi. You can also call me Bips. I am someone who wants to try things myself rather
  than listing to other people opinions. I always want to learn something new, something tuff , fail at it and get back
  up again. This attitude in me is very helpful for me because I think this is the only way I can discover my true
  passion and work on that for the rest of my life. I am a very positive person who is always seeking for improvement. I
  love working on myself to make me a better human being every next day.
</p>
<p>
  I have some hobbies that helps me boost my mood anytime. Writing stories or poetries, photography,
  videography , playing ukulele etc are always inside my radar. I tend to enjoy these creative aspect in myself which I
  will definitely keep continuing. I heard that to be a better Developer in the IT industry creative aspect of yourself
  is a big bonus. Therefore I am very optimistic about it. Thank you and have a great day. Cheers
</p>
